# Windows-Active-Directory
Documented my experience of setting up Windows Active Directory on a Windows Server 2016 VM in Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1X

By the end of this, I have:
1.	Installed Oracle VMware
2.	Set up Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 Enterprise in a VM environments
3.	Created and set up an Active Directory on Windows Server 2016
4.	Made the Active Directory a Domain Controller
5.	Added a new User into the Domain
6.	Set up a new Windows10 Enterprise account
7.	Set the account up with standard permissions and successfully logged into the local Domain
