# Windows-Active-Directory
Documented my experience of setting up Windows Active Directory on a Windows Server 2016 VM in Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1X
> Note: I previously installed Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1X for this project

By the end of this, I have:
1. Set up Windows Server 2016 in a VM environment
2. Set up Windows 10 Enterprise in a VM environment
3. Created and set up Windows Active Directory on Windows Server 2016
4. Set up DNS and made the Active Directory a Domain Controller
5. Set up a new Windows10 Enterprise account
6. Added a new User into the Domain
8. Set the account up with standard permissions and successfully logged into the local Domain
